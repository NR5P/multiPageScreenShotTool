# Multi Page Screen Shot Tool

## The Problem
Some online books or web pages can be formated in a way in which it's extremely difficult or impossible to download or print many pages of materials. This simple scipt takes a specified number of pages and x, y coordinates on the screen for the screen shot. It then puts each screen shot into a single pdf. This should not be used on copyrighted material or without the authors permission.
